# ft_gkrellm
rush01 Piscine CPP @42born2code

Still an embrion a lot of TODO.
The aim of this project is to create a gkrellm like widget application to view's macOS system info and statistics.

The code quality is pretty poor since we had two days to make it.
Hope I'll get the time to refactor and improve it.
